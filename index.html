  <h3>About This Module</h3>
  <p>Imagine you are the creative director of a design/branding agency. AI has gradually become more involved in creative processes.

To test the limits of AI’s current creative capabilities, we ran the gauntlet against a fully human-designed campaign. Both were given the task to develop an organic orange juice brand called “Greene’s”. AI was fed the most relevant prompts for each step of the process from generating a mood board to the final product. </p>
